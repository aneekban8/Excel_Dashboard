Excel Dashboard.
The file "Excel Dashboard2.xlsx" contains an example of Excel dashboard in "Sheet1" created using advanced Excel formula and dependent dropdown lists. Please scroll the sheet if the charts do not appear to be updating due to lack of memory on system.
In the file "Excel Dashboard2_macro_V2.xlsm" there is a VBA procedure chk_data in Module 2. The job of this procedure is to check, that for newly added data, each seller sells each product for each quarter. If this condition holds then the procedure generates the message "Data quality is OK". If a certain seller does not sell a certain product in a certain quarter then the procedure generates the message "Data quality is bad".
